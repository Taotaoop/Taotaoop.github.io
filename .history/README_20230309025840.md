## Concepts of Etter's Book
### Use Lightweight Markup
- As Andrew Etter said in Modern technical Weiring *"One of the tenets of mordern technical weiting is that everyone is a contributor"*. Lightweight markup languages like Markdown elimate the barriers of price, learning curve, and portability. First, the markdown content is hunman-readable in raw form, it is clear and easy to read and write. Second, markdown keep the consistent format on any system. No metter what text editor you use, you will allways see the same effect. And because of this, Markdown can be easily transform into other format such as PDF, HTML, DOCX, etc. These features of Markdown encourage people to contribute, as all barriers are removed. To encourage our audiences to used Markdown, the README and resume file of this project are both formatted in Markdown and a Markdown tutorial link is also included in [Step 4](#step-4-upload-resume-in-markdown-format). 
### Use Distributed Version Control
- Andrew Etter has extolled the benifits of distributed version control system in his book. DVCS allows offline and concurrent work on the same file. Which it provides us the ability to track and recover any modifications of our project. And it encourages developer to contribute or re-produce. Althought it has some drawback but it is still a very powerful tool. In this project, we have demonsrated the use of GitHub and GitHub Desktop to create and edit our repository in [Step 3](#step-3-creat-a-repository), and [Step 6](#step-6-deploy-on-github).
